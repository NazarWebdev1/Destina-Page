			<h2>Destinapost's main objectives are:</h2>
			<p>- Reduce gas emissions (CO2).</p>
			<p>- Avoid fraud in classified ads online or elsewhere.</p>
			<p>- Easily provide the opportunity for people to buy used consumer goods and give them a second life.</p>
		</div>

	<section class="cd-fixed-background img-2" data-type="slider-item">
		<div class="cd-content light-background text-content">
			<h2>Its operation:</h2>
			<p>Firstly, the buyer wishing to acquire the goods must inform the seller if he accepts that a third party can contact him to verify the accuracy of the product description, 
			to schedule the appointment and during the appointments check the condition of the product, take into account the criteria provided by the buyer and conclude the transaction.</p>
			<p><br>The customer subscribes to the service through the web platform, if this has not already been done. In the section: submit a pickup, he enters the contact details of the seller,
			he selects the category of the product and the required details. The client must select an agent who will act as an agent on behalf of the client and must be within 50km (31 miles)
			of the seller. The client makes the payment and can contact the agent when the agent accepts the work, as judging it appropriate. The agent in possession of the item, takes measurements,
			fits a box for shipping, if it is necessary (to minimize shipping costs), prints a packing slip and brings the parcel to USPS or Canada Post. The national postal service delivers the parcel
			to the customer (at a nearest point of service), a signature and proof of identity is required.</p>

	<section class="cd-fixed-background img-3" data-type="slider-item">
		<div class="cd-content text-content">
			<h2>The main advantages:</h2>
			<p>- Using our services would save on expensive travel expenses if the item is several hundred kilometers from the buyer. Because it will be in many cases more economical to use our services and postal
			service than to travel by car.<br>
			- Saving time that can be invested with family, friends, etc. instead of taking the road for hours.<br>
			- Significant reduction of CO2 because we would use the existing transport infrastructure deployed by the national postal services.<br>
			- More Profit for USPS and Canada Post<br>
			- Getting an item as expected</p>

	<section class="cd-fixed-background img-4" data-type="slider-item">
		<div class="cd-content text-content">
			<h2>Challenges:</h2>
			<p>To make the project a reality, we need a mechanism from USPS and Canada Post. This mechanism initially consists of obtaining an account for large companies from them that would create 
			sub-accounts that each have their own mailing address. Holders of these accounts would belong to Destinapost agents. Agents would print shipping labels and the invoice would be sent 
			to the primary account (parent account).</p>
			<p><br>Currently the mechanism exists and is offered by USPS and Canada Post but certain conditions are required.</p>
			<p><br>Canada Post conditions:</p>
			<p><br>- Get a convention #.
			<br>- Sign a commercial contract and specify the terms and conditions
			<br>- Have a high volume of sending parcels
			We are not eligible, considering that we don’t have a large volume of shipping. We didn’t send anything because we don’t have started our operations yet.
			The terms of USPS are substantially the same, we couldn’t also be eligible because USPS requires that each of the sub-accounts can send dozens of packages per day.
			Volunteer programmers are ready to create the app that avoids spending a dollar. The usual cost to design such an application is between $ 40,000 and $ 50,000.
			USPS and Canada Post have offered some things to us, however their proposals do not offer any arrangement that meets the needs of the organization.
			We may have sub-accounts, however these sub-accounts can only have the same sender address which is the main account address (parent account). 
			Which is totally different from the account dedicated to large companies. Other carriers offer the desired services at disproportionate costs.</p>

			<h2>Needs:</h2>
			<p>1. Allow to get an account for big business</p>
			<p>2. Get a convention #.</p>
			<p>3. Carry the cost of shipments and pay the bill monthly</p>
			<p>4. Sign a flexible contract. An important clause would be to be able to update the list of sub-accounts and its holders (each account would have its own postal address, 
			it would calculate the actual cost of the shipment depending on the location of the account holder). The frequency to apply the changes must be allowed at 
			least once a month. Constantly adding and subtracting new sub-accounts within a reasonable period of time (depending on the frequency) would better serve the market by serving new 
			territories quickly. Allow the master account holder to immediately suspend any sub-account, for security and monetary aspects.</p>
			<p>5. Obtain the discounts applicable to each threshold reached (requires an evaluation every 3 months).</p>
			<p>6. That USPS and Canada Post adapt their services taking into account the objectives of Destinapost</p>
			<br><p>Some clarifications are necessary. All shipments would be made exclusively within the operations of the organization and it would be the responsibility of the organization to
			verify and prove that all shipments are legitimate. Canada Post has more than 6,400 points of service and USPS has more than 31,000 points of service, this vast network would 
			allow us to operate with a favorable business model that would allow competitive prices and could incite users to use our services that would have positive consequences for the environment.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
					<p>The solution is within reach, it is enough of the will and to deploy the necessary resources, whereas our initiative makes 
					it possible concretely and effectively to fight against the climatic changes and this without investment of the governments.<br></p>
					<p>The eligibility criteria are arbitrary and we ask USPS and Canada Post to be flexible and it doesn’t require any investment from them.</p><br>
					<p>Let's change old models by adapting them to meet new realities. Hoping that this initiative is born by your support!</p>
