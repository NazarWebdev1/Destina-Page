        <h1>#FAQ(?)? or Questions you might ask yourself:</h2>
        <div class="col-12">
            <h2>Q1 : Who would be the agents?</h2>
            <div class="faq-description">
                <p>Students or people from all walks of life who decide on their availability. All will have to go through a selection process (examination, record check and 
                    criminal record, references, etc.)</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12">
            <h2>Q2: Why would not the agents send themselves from their own personal account, when they receive the money first?</h2>
            <div class="faq-description">
                <p>- Shipments could not be combined and therefore we would not be able to obtain discounts or preserve the eligibility of the organization because Canada Post
                     and USPS are requesting a threshold.<br>
                     - it would be impossible to quickly and efficiently track shipments. We couldnâ€™t ensure a good quality of service.<br>
                     - We would depend on employees to obtain information on the actions committed in their account (know the dimensions of the packages, the date and time of 
                     sending, contact details of the customer, etc.).<br>
                     - This would make our operations expensive, slow and difficult.<br>
                     - We want to avoid additional transactions.<br>
                     - and more.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12">
            <h2>Q3 : Why not use the services of USPS and Canada Post competitors?</h2>
            <div class="faq-description">
                <p>The costs are less attractive and their facilities (points of service too far away, fewer points of service, etc.) do not achieve our 
                    environmental and economic objectives. There are fewer points of service and especially in remote areas.<br>
                   Any questions, comments, suggestions and help are welcome.</p>
